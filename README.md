The goal of the game is to guess the number that the computer randomly dials in the range that the user dials at the beginning of the game. A player needs to guess a number from 10 attempts. In case he doesn't hit the number from 10 attempts, the player loses. During the game there is a small help that tells the player whether the selected number is less than or greater than the randomly selected number or outside the defined range of numbers. When the player guesses the number, the message CONGRATULATIONS! appears on the screen and from which attempt he guessed the number.
